                                Starting out at the age of 12 I never stopped learning new programming skills and
                                languages. This passion has since lasted and lead to my decision of working as a
                                freelance web developer and consultant. Starting web development on the
                                backend I also became more and more of a frontend developer using modern frameworks like
                                React, Angular or VueJS in a lot of projects. I love both worlds nowadays! As a
                                self-taught professional I really know the hard parts and the difficult topics when
                                learning new or improving on already-known languages. My track record of many 5-star
                                rated courses and more than 2,000,000 students on Udemy is the best proof for that.
